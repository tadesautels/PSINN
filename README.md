# Summary
PSINN is a neural-network-based dynamics estimation project. It uses a neural network (NN) to learn low-dimensional shape functions 
(denoted with the Greek letter psi) that are composited together into an estimate of the dynamics operator. 

The neural network infrastructure for PSINN is TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
